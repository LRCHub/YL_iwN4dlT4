You like to catch me off guard
So it's hard to keep my balance
And you know how to get inside
And you know how to love me right
And I'm not ready to let you go just yet
Do we have more time left to stretch?
'Cause I'm not ready yet

Let me down, let me down
Let me down slow
Stick around, draw it out
'Til there's nowhere else to go
Pushing me along a string
And if you're finally breaking free
Let me down slowly
Let me down slowly

We always take it too far
And we're up for any challenge
You know when I get excited
You know how to keep me smiling
I'm not ready to let you go just yet
Do we have more time left to stretch?
'Cause I'm not ready yet

Let me down, let me down
Let me down slow
Stick around, draw it out
'Til there's nowhere else to go
Pushing me along a string
And if you're finally breaking free
Let me down slowly
Let me down slowly

Take your time with me
Stretch the seconds out
Keep the waves rolling
Keep it calm before the storm comes round and drowns me

Let me down, let me down
Let me down slow
Stick around, draw it out
'Til there's nowhere else to go
Pushing me along a string
And if you're finally breaking free
Let me down slowly
Let me down slowly
Let me down slowly
Let me down slowly
